"""float data type
it is used to represent decimal numbers or floating-point numbers.
Floating-point numbers are represented using the float class in Python.
The float class is a built-in class in Python that provides methods and attributes for working with floating-point numbers.
Floating-point numbers can be of arbitrary size, meaning they can be as large or as small as the memory allows.

# # Example of float data type
# a = 3.14
# b = -0.001
# c = 2.0
# d = 1.5e2  # scientific notation
# e = 1.5E2  # scientific notation
# print("a:", a, type(a))
# The type() function returns the type of the object passed to it.
''' How to round off a float number'''
# # Python provides the round() function to round off a float number.
# # The round() function takes a float number as an argument and returns the rounded value of the float number.
# a=3.44777
# print(a)
# print (round(a))
# print(round(a,2))#upto 2 decimal places
'''convert int to float'''
# a=2
# print(a,type(a))
# b=float(a)
# print(b,type(b))
